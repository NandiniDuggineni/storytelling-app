Far, far away in a big, beautiful night sky, there lived a tiny star named Luma.
She was the smallest star in her whole cluster.

One night, the Moon was counting his starry friends.
But sometimes, he forgot Luma was even there.

Luma wished she could shine brighter, so everyone would see her light.
