Welcome to a bedtime story of The Little shiny star

Once upon a time, high up in the bright blue sky, there was a little fluffy cloud named Puffy. Puffy wasn’t like the big clouds that could bring rain or thunder. Puffy was small and soft and didn’t know what special thing he could do.


Every day, Puffy watched the big clouds help the flowers grow by dropping raindrops. He wanted to help too, but he didn’t know how. “Maybe I’m too little,” he thought sadly.


One morning, Puffy saw a group of children playing in the park. They looked up at the sky, pointing at Puffy. “Look! That cloud looks like a bunny!” one girl said with a smile.


Puffy wiggled happily. Maybe being a cloud that makes fun shapes was his special gift! So he puffed up and changed shape, turning into a fluffy bunny, a big fish, and even a soaring bird.


The children laughed and clapped, and Puffy felt warm inside. He realized it didn’t matter if he couldn’t make rain or thunder — he could make people smile just by being himself.


From that day on, Puffy happily floated across the sky, making all sorts of shapes, brightening everyone’s day with his magical cloud stories.

Thanks for watching
