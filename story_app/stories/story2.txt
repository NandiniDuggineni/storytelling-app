Mom: Good evening, dear. Are you ready for your bedtime story?

Child: Yes, Mom! I canâ€™t wait to hear it.

Mom: Once upon a time, in a quiet forest, there lived a little fox named Felix.

Narrator: Felix was curious and loved to explore.

Child: What adventures did Felix have, Mom?

Mom: One day, Felix found a sparkling river that sang beautiful songs.

Narrator: He followed the river and met new friends along the way.

Child: That sounds magical!

Mom: Yes, and Felix learned that kindness makes every journey brighter.

Narrator: And with a happy heart, Felix returned home to sleep peacefully.

Mom: The end. Sweet dreams, my little one.

Child: Thank you, Mom. Goodnight!
